# Use API and Python to Gather Ideal Vacation Spot
## Summary 
University of Texas Data Analytics Bootcamp Challenge using Python and API interactions to determine the best vacation spot for my very specific humidity and temperature preferences. I started with no code and completed the task with an interactive Google Map that pinned the perfect locations with Hotel names for my next vacation.

### APIs Used:
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)
  * For heatmaps and pins on locations.
* [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/)
  * For gatheirng current weather data.

### Other Tools:
* [PyPl citypy](https://pypi.org/project/citipy/)
  * Python library of cities.
* [Juptyer Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
  * A tool great for visualizing data quickly with python code. Matplotlib executes inline.
